# Hi, I'm Byron ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for building web applications, specializing in frontend development.

I love open-sourceâ€”I credit my entire career to it. While I donâ€™t always have time to contribute as much as Iâ€™d like, I make it a priority to give back to the community whenever possible.

## ðŸš€ Open-Source Contributions

A selection of my open-source contributions that highlight my skills and impact.


### Laravel - TypeScript Transformations

At a previous employer, as part of an initiative to modernize our frontend practices, our team needed a way to share enums between our Laravel backend and React SPA. The existing solution, [TypeScript Transformer](https://spatie.be/docs/typescript-transformer/v2/introduction), was a great starting point but didnâ€™t fully meet our requirements.

To address this, I contributed to the project by submitting pull requests to enhance its extensibility, which were welcomed by the author:

- [Extracting output formatting to configurable implementation](https://github.com/spatie/typescript-transformer/pull/7)
- [Add support for custom Writers](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-typescript-transformer/pull/7)
- [Proposed inclusion of a custom adapter](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-typescript-transformer/pull/6)
- [Developed a custom adapter](https://github.com/wt-health/laravel-enum-transformer)

These contributions helped streamline our development process by enabling better type safety and code consistency between our backend and frontend.

### Symfony Mailer AWS/SES Transport

While working with Symfony's Mailer component, I encountered an issue where AWS authentication was not working correctly. After investigating, I discovered the problem stemmed from the request-signing logic.

Fixing this required a major refactor of the library, which would take time. To address the issue in the interim, I created a custom adapter as a temporary workaround and released it as an open-source package.

- [Reported the issue with a reproducer](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/35468)
- [Suggested changes to improve extensibility](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/35469)
- [Published a custom mailer transport package to provide a temporary fix](https://github.com/badams/symfony-mailer-amazon-sdk)

This contribution helped bridge the gap while the Symfony maintainers worked on a long-term solution, ensuring projects relying on AWS mail transports could function correctly.


### Blueprint - A React-based UI toolkit for the web

While adopting the Blueprint UI toolkit, I discovered and resolved several issues related to rendering, layout, and styling.

- [Ensured popovers re-render when content resizes](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/pull/2718)
- [Fixed button text rendering issue when content is `0`](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/pull/2727)
- [Investigated and reported an issue with nested popovers and menus and event propagation](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/issues/2735)
- [Fixed `border-radius` for `ControlGroup` with a single child](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/pull/2734)
- [Fixed `border-radius` issue for `ControlGroup` children wrapped with `Popover`](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/issues/2730)

These contributions enhanced layout consistency, visual accuracy, and user experience within the Blueprint UI framework.


### Electron Builder

While developing an Electron application, we adopted the `electron-builder` package to manage builds and distribution. During implementation, I identified areas for improvement in the auto-update functionality and contributed enhancements to the project.

- [Implemented support for `download-progress` events, enabling real-time progress bars and download speed indicators](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/pull/1042)
- [Resolved issues with Google Cloud Storage as a hosting provider](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/pull/1040)
- [Fixed issue fetching releases from GitHub](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/pull/1114)

These contributions helped improve the developer experience by making the auto-update process more reliable and transparent for users.
### Yasumi

I came across a public holiday calculation library on Reddit and decided to contribute in its early stages. My contributions focused on improving code quality and adding support for New Zealand holidays.

- [Added support for New Zealand holidays](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/13)
- [Standardized code formatting with php-cs-fixer](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/16)
- [Fixed incorrect timezone for Norway provider causing tests to fail](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/12)

### Laravel JSON Schema Request Validation

For a project I was working on, we needed to validate incoming API requests based on a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) document. Since no existing solution met our needs, I developed a custom library and released it as an open-source package.

**Repository:** [wt-health/laravel-json-schema-request](https://github.com/wt-health/laravel-json-schema-request)


## ðŸ“– Ancient History

### Translator addon for Firefox

Back when I was a student (circa 2005â€“2006), I developed a Firefox addon called **Translator**. My goal was simple: make translating web pages as seamless as possible. I focused heavily on the user experience, ensuring that translations felt intuitive and integrated smoothly into the browser.

This project was a pivotal moment in my journey as a developerâ€”it was my first real exposure to **JavaScript**, as well as markup languages like **XUL** and **XSLT**. It taught me not just the technical aspects of building browser extensions but also the importance of designing for usability. I received a steady stream of feedback and feature requests, which helped me refine the interface and improve the overall user experience.

Translator gained significant traction, reaching **150,000 daily active users** at its peak. At one point, I was even approached to have it featured in a couple of French technology magazines (though I never actually saw the issues!).

Unfortunately, the original codebase was lost when Google Code shut down. However, I later rewrote the addon to leverage modern translation APIs, proxying requests through my own API hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

I did manage to find [this video](https://youtu.be/o1--tFYzJ-o) showcasing the original UI, and as a fun bonus, I even received [this cool t-shirt](https://www.flickr.com/photos/minghan/2537726693/) as part of my involvement in the Mozilla community.

Beyond Translator, I was deeply involved in the Addons Mozilla (AMO) community, actively participating in discussions on IRC. I later joined the AMO team as an official reviewer, helping assess addon submissions, conducting manual code reviews, and identifying malicious code.


### PEAR Validation Library

My earliest open-source contribution came as a student when I got involved with the **PEAR** community. Communication was primarily done via mailing lists and IRCâ€”I still remember the flack I received for my incorrectly configured spaces in my very first commit!

I was fortunate to be mentored by a core developer, which helped me grow as a programmer. Over time, I contributed by developing several localized validation packages for the PEAR project.

- [New Zealand Validation](https://github.com/pear/Validate_NZ/blob/112e6b08630ec122859c544274fe6d32a4872a32/Validate/NZ.php#L25)
- [Australia Validation](https://github.com/pear/Validate_AU/blob/0a9c3bdec9181035f9cf9f457b3f7736713d6c3e/Validate/AU.php#L21)
- [India Validation](https://github.com/pear/Validate_IN/blob/ca028f452895e3990e754f6bfde211350883385e/Validate/IN.php#L19)
- [Austria Validation](https://github.com/pear/Validate_AT/blob/a012f817617646c68f29ca37c143ff56bbe23cd3/Validate/AT.php#L19)

This experience was a foundational moment in my journey as a developer, teaching me the importance of code quality, community collaboration, and maintainability.
